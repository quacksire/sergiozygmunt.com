## Yearbook Superlatives and Biography collection system (2015)
A web application that I’ve developed for use by Carmel High School Students to place their votes for our school’s senior superlatives. This application also allows students to input their senior quotes and other biographical information (future plans, nicknames, etc.). Students log in with their school network user name and password and enter their biographies which is associated to their directory object.

## County Fair Management System (2014 - present)
A web interface used by the Grounds Crew for receiving and updating the status of grounds service calls (move tables requests, lower tent walls requests, etc.) for the Putnam County 4-H Fair. Call takers sit in a designated area and receive calls from Fair Volunteers who were previously provided the GroundsDirect phone number. They then enter the requests into GroundsDirect which are received by the Grounds Crew. Once the request is resolved, Grounds Crew enters the status of the request into GroundsDirect, and the result is written to the database.

## Putnam County Historical Markers Project (2012 - 2017)
A project involving interactive and dynamic web pages for pre-existing historical cast iron marker signs throughout my home county. I am working with the local county government to place QR code tags on both the signs and on posters at popular points of interest.
