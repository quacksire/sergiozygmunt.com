## AmIOnVPN.com

A PHP program which checks the current user's public IP address and compares it to a list of known IP addresses/hostnames and reports to the user which network they care connected to. It's useful becuase it lets people know if they are indeed connected to VPN or not. [Docs](https://s.psdsuc.com/ldtej).

## US TSA Boarding Pass Scanner Sign in and Attendance Program (2016 - currently being used by robotics team)

I re-programmed a TSA boarding pass scanner (DESKO PENTA) via its SDK to allow for the logging of sign in and sign outs via 2D barcode scanning. I did this project to help my [robotics team](https://s.psdsuc.com/jf5ud) keep track of members' contribution hours.

The SDK portion of the code is closed-source at the request of the manufacturer. The rest is available in a PDF file

## Yearbook Superlatives and Biography collection system (2015)
A web application that I’ve developed for use by Carmel High School Students to place their votes for our school’s senior superlatives. This application also allows students to input their senior quotes and other biographical information (future plans, nicknames, etc.). Students log in with their school network user name and password and enter their biographies which is associated to their directory object.

## Community Technology Program

I designed and currently ran a free community program which provides local community members with a number of technology resources via in-person sessions and Online training.

## AssetAware (2015)

I initially developed AssetAware to help me inventory my belongings for insurance purposes. It allows for the entering of information such as serial numbers, model numbers, value, purchase date, etc. I further expanded the application to allow small businesses to manage their assets within an Office365 tenant rather than spend thousands of dollars on competing software. I copyrighted AssetAware in 2016 and plan on releasing the source code as a low-cost product for small businesses to manage their fixed assets.

## County Fair Management System (2014 - present)
A web interface used by the Grounds Crew for receiving and updating the status of grounds service calls (move tables requests, lower tent walls requests, etc.) for the Putnam County 4-H Fair. Call takers sit in a designated area and receive calls from Fair Volunteers who were previously provided the GroundsDirect phone number. They then enter the requests into GroundsDirect which are received by the Grounds Crew. Once the request is resolved, Grounds Crew enters the status of the request into GroundsDirect, and the result is written to the database.

## Putnam County Historical Markers Project (2012 - 2017)
A project involving interactive and dynamic web pages for pre-existing historical cast iron marker signs throughout my home county. I am working with the local county government to place QR code tags on both the signs and on posters at popular points of interest.
